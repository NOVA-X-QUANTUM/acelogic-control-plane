# ✨ Overview

ACELOGIC™ is a deterministic identity and execution governance layer for distributed AI infrastructure.

This production-grade implementation introduces:

- deterministic identity enforcement
- continuity-aware execution governance
- duplicate-runtime prevention
- canonical workload validation
- policy-bound execution control
- runtime continuity enforcement
- split-brain protection
- fail-closed execution governance

directly into Kubernetes-native infrastructure.

ACELOGIC™ operates as a decentralized governance control plane for autonomous systems running across:

- Kubernetes environments
- cloud infrastructure
- edge orchestration
- distributed AI systems
- AI-native runtime environments
- AI-RAN / telecom infrastructure

---

# 🚨 The Infrastructure Problem

Modern orchestration systems restore workloads.

They do not preserve deterministic execution identity.

As autonomous systems evolve into persistent runtime actors, infrastructure must determine:

- whether execution authority remains valid
- whether another runtime already resumed execution
- whether continuity has diverged
- whether execution paths have forked
- whether the workload is canonical

Traditional orchestration systems can unintentionally permit duplicate autonomous runtimes across distributed infrastructure.

This creates split-brain execution:

multiple concurrent workloads operating under conflicting authority states.

ACELOGIC™ introduces deterministic governance directly into the runtime admission path before execution is permitted.

---

# ⚡ Why ACELOGIC™ Exists

Traditional orchestration systems schedule workloads.

They do NOT verify:

- whether a workload is canonical
- whether another instance already resumed execution
- whether identity continuity remains intact
- whether runtime authority is still valid
- whether execution paths have forked

As autonomous systems become persistent runtime actors, infrastructure requires:

- deterministic identity
- continuity enforcement
- runtime governance
- execution authority validation
- duplicate-agent prevention
- split-brain protection

ACELOGIC™ introduces deterministic identity governance directly into the execution path.

# Architecture Overview

ACELOGIC™ follows a decentralized Git-driven policy distribution architecture.

Policies are distributed through Kubernetes-native synchronization mechanisms while enforcement occurs locally at cluster admission time.

This architecture enables:

- deterministic runtime governance
- cluster-local enforcement
- continuity-aware orchestration
- fail-closed execution control
- distributed execution integrity
- split-brain prevention

without centralized runtime dependencies.

# 🔐 Deterministic Governance Model

ACELOGIC™ introduces identity-aware runtime enforcement directly into Kubernetes execution flow.

Every workload must validate:

- canonical identity fingerprint
- purpose hash integrity
- continuity lineage
- active execution authority
- valid execution lease
- namespace continuity
- policy compliance

before execution is permitted.

If continuity validation fails:

- execution is denied
- SAFE_MODE may be enforced
- mutation authority is revoked
- duplicate execution paths are rejected
- conflicting authority states are blocked

This prevents:

- split-brain execution
- duplicate autonomous runtimes
- continuity divergence
- conflicting authority states
- unauthorized workload resurrection
- runtime fork attempts

---

# 🌐 Infrastructure Positioning

ACELOGIC™ operates ABOVE orchestration infrastructure.

| Infrastructure Layer | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| Kubernetes | workload scheduling |
| Argo CD / Config Sync | deployment synchronization |
| OpenTelemetry | tracing instrumentation |
| Prometheus | metrics collection |
| ACELOGIC™ | identity + continuity + execution governance |

ACELOGIC™ governs whether autonomous workloads are permitted to execute.

---

# ☸️ Kubernetes Integration

ACELOGIC™ integrates directly into Kubernetes-native infrastructure using:

- admission webhooks
- CRD-based policy definitions
- namespace isolation
- GitOps distribution
- cluster-local evaluation
- runtime enforcement hooks

This enables deterministic enforcement before workload execution resumes.

---

# 🌐 Distributed Infrastructure Support

ACELOGIC™ is designed for distributed environments including:

- multi-cluster Kubernetes
- edge orchestration
- private cloud infrastructure
- AI-native compute environments
- AI-RAN / telecom infrastructure
- disconnected or partitioned runtime environments

The architecture enables:

- continuity-safe recovery
- deterministic runtime governance
- distributed identity propagation
- canonical execution preservation
- continuity-aware failover

across cloud, edge, and telecom infrastructure.

| `admission_deny_total` | Rejected workload admissions |
| `identity_verify_fail_total` | Identity fingerprint validation failures |
| `purpose_verify_fail_total` | Purpose hash validation failures |
| `continuity_fail_total` | Duplicate identity or continuity failures |
| `lease_expired_total` | Expired lease rejections |
| `safe_mode_total` | SAFE_MODE enforcement events |
